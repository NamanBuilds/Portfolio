        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            Hello, I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology degree with a focus on
            Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I am building this portfolio as a practice
            project to strengthen my understanding of HTML and website structure.
        </p>

        <p>
            I believe in understanding how things work at their core. This site tracks my progress as I move from the first principles to finished products.
